// @ts-nocheck - vendored plain JavaScript; see scripts/vendor.mjs for why it is not type-checked.
// VENDORED from Star System Explorer, src/lib/import/realsky/constants.mjs — copied on 2026-09-23.
// DO NOT EDIT HERE without making the same change in the engine: this file has a twin, and the
// two drifting apart is the known cost of the copy. Re-copy with scripts/vendor.mjs; the import
// paths and that script's declared substitutions are the only intended differences.
// Real-sky import — shared physical constants and map conventions.
//
// Plain ESM with no imports, because two very different consumers share it:
// the Vite-bundled app (src/lib/import/realsky/*) and the plain-node build kit
// (scripts/starmap-build/*, spawned by buildKit.spec.mjs as `node ...`).
// Anything TypeScript-only or $lib-aliased here would break the kit.
//
// These values are the single source: the build kit re-exports what it needs
// from here. If a number must change, it changes here and the bundled maps are
// regenerated in the same commit (see scripts/starmap-build/README.md — the
// kit and the shipped maps are pinned to each other by buildKit.spec.mjs).
