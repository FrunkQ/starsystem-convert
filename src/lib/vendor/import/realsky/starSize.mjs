// DERIVING A STAR'S SIZE FROM WHAT A CATALOGUE ACTUALLY MEASURES (D29, stream U).
//
// THE FAULT THIS EXISTS TO FIX: every real star imported from the stellar census carried its class
// BAND MIDPOINT as its mass, radius and temperature. Sirius B came in at 1.000 Msun because that is
// the middle of the white-dwarf band, Proxima at 0.400 Rsun against a true 0.154. The owner's report
// was "the importer still not adding the radii or masses for real stars", and he was right.
//
// AND THE OBVIOUS FIX DOES NOT EXIST. The brief asked for "the mass/radius/temperature columns
// SIMBAD exposes". MEASURED 2026-09-08 against TAP_SCHEMA: SIMBAD's `basic` table HAS NO SUCH
// COLUMNS, and SIMBAD carries no stellar mass anywhere at all. Gaia DR3 would have them and is a
// dead end for this region - the nearby stars are too bright for it and Sirius is absent outright.
// So a size is DERIVED here, from quantities that ARE measured, or it is not claimed.
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED, over the 74 stars of the Local Neighbourhood census (`skyFixtures.ts`):
//   parallax        74/74   `basic.plx_value`
//   temperature     64/74   `mesFe_h.teff`        - a direct measurement, used as one
//   surface gravity 62/74   `mesFe_h.log_g`       - MEASURED AND DELIBERATELY NOT USED, see below
//   K magnitude     63/74   `allfluxes.K`
//   V magnitude     59/74   `allfluxes.V`
//   diameter        10/74   `mesDiameter`         - the only direct radius there is
//
// THE SHAPE IS A TABLE OF RELATIONS, EACH WITH A DECLARED DOMAIN, AND NOT ONE FORMULA. That is not
// tidiness: a single relation applied everywhere is exactly how this goes wrong. Flower's
// bolometric correction recovers Sirius A to 1.740 Rsun against a true 1.711, and hands Proxima
// 0.887 Rsun against a true 0.154 - four hundred and seventy-six per cent out, and confidently so.
// Every relation below therefore states where it is allowed to answer, and OUTSIDE ALL OF THEM THE
// CLASS BAND STAYS, flagged as typical. A band midpoint that says it is a band midpoint is honest;
// a derived figure outside its calibration is not.
//
// WHY `log_g` IS FETCHED AND NOT USED FOR MASS. M = gR^2/G is exact and the temptation is obvious.
// Measured against the truth set in `starSize.spec.ts` it is the worst of the three options:
// Procyon +70%, eps Ind -40%, eps Eri -36%, against a class band that is consistently within about
// 15%. The error is not in the algebra - it is that a spectroscopic log g carries ~0.1-0.2 dex of
// scatter and R^2 multiplies whatever the radius got wrong. The mass-luminosity relation, on the
// same stars, gives Procyon +6.8% and alf Cen A +2.7%. So log_g is carried for provenance and
// diagnostics and the mass comes from luminosity. An ASTEROSEISMIC log g would flip that judgement.
//
// DEGENERATE AND SUBSTELLAR OBJECTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM EVERY RELATION HERE, and that is a physics
// decision rather than caution. A white dwarf is supported by electron degeneracy and sits nowhere
// near any main-sequence relation - Sirius B comes out 99% wrong through Flower. A brown dwarf's
// radius is set by degeneracy too, which is why DATA-R24 records that the identical 80,006 km on
// every L, T and Y dwarf is HONEST rather than a bug. Both keep their bands, which are right.
//
// PLAIN ESM, NO IMPORTS BEYOND `constants.mjs` - DATA-R5. The build kit runs this under bare node.
