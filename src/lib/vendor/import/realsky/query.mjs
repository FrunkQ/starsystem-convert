// for Sirius, 117 for Arcturus - so joining it beside `allfluxes` and `mesDiameter` in a single
// select multiplies the row count by that. They are kept apart and reduced caller-side.
//

// its class band, exactly as it did before this existed - see `loadStarSizes`.

// One row per object: the magnitudes, and a direct diameter where SIMBAD has one.
// `allfluxes` is one row per object; `mesDiameter` is rare enough (10 of 74 locally) that its
// multiplicity costs nothing. THE `unit` COLUMN IS FETCHED BECAUSE IT VARIES PER ROW - SIMBAD writes
// 'mas' for an interferometric diameter and 'km' for a derived one, and HD 95735 carries one of each.

// which is precisely why no query the importer could make ever returned them: every star query
// carries `plx_value > 0`. That clause is right for a whole-sky census (a row with no parallax
// cannot be placed) and wrong here, where the parent's parallax is the answer: two members of one
// system are at the same distance, which is the same reasoning `census.projectedSeparationAu`
// already relies on.
