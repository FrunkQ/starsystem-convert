// Owner, 2026-08-12: "planets that large are more likely to be gas giants than
// terrestrial — even a super-Earth is smaller than 4 M⊕ — so just a gas giant
// profile, any in the range". So mass alone decides here, and it decides ONCE:
// there is no second, heavier threshold below which a giant could still be read
// as rock. That is what makes D17 structurally impossible rather than guarded
// against — the density is simply never consulted for a giant.

// and this range is deliberately not a new model: `makeupFractions` infers
// {gas: 0.80, ice: 0.20} for any body over 8 M⊕ below 2.5 g/cc, and
// `generateBodyOfType` falls back to {gas: 0.92, ice: 0.08} for a generated

//
// WHY MASS ALONE ABOVE THE CEILING, AND WHY THIS DISSOLVES D7 RATHER THAN
// PATCHING IT: pscomppars BACK-FILLS `pl_rade` from `pl_bmasse` for three
// quarters of its rows, then computes `pl_dens` from that pair (DATA-R7). So for
// most planets the density is a re-encoding of the mass and carries no
// independent information — which is why every 4–40 M⊕ planet used to come out
// at exactly 55% ice, and why the map could not express any other answer. Not
// consulting a circular number is the fix; there is nothing to weigh it against.
//
// The variation is DETERMINISTIC, seeded on the body's own id with the same
// `hash01` that already fixes its orbital elements — so a re-import reproduces
// the same worlds (DATA-R2), and a starmap of imported giants varies the way a
// generated one does instead of repeating one figure down the whole map.
// Did the catalogue MEASURE this radius, or compute it from the mass? pscomppars
// back-fills `pl_rade` with essentially the Chen-Kipping relation `estimateRadiusRe`
// implements above, so a row whose radius reproduces that estimate is telling us
// the mass a second time. 135 of the 182 rows in the committed cache match it to
// within 1%, most to within 0.3% — this is a measurement, not a guess (DATA-R7).

  // e, a well-characterised lava world). Calling those gas giants would discard
  // real evidence in favour of a rule of thumb, and the rule of thumb exists
  // only BECAUSE the usual density is circular.
  //
  // WHY IT STOPS AT THE GIANT THRESHOLD, which is D17 and cost this exception a
  // regression before the tests caught it: eps Ind A b has a measured radius too
  // (12.7 R⊕ against the estimator's 12) and a real 5.54 g/cc, so "measured and
  // dense" is TRUE for it — and it is a 6.5 Jupiter-mass super-Jupiter. Past the

  // (DATA-R7), so no evidence about density can make a giant rocky.
