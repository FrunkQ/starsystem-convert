// NASA Exoplanet Archive pscomppars rows → SSE starmap system nodes: one
// system per hostname, star parameters from the archive's stellar columns,
// planets exactly as confirmed, positions true and centre-relative. Nothing
// is invented: a host missing a mass or radius is SKIPPED with a reason the
// UI must show, never guessed into existence.
//
// Collision protection is about the TARGET MAP, not about the bundled maps.
// A host is skipped only when the system it would produce is ALREADY ON THE
// MAP being imported into — either under the same id, or under the stable id
// the bundled starmaps give that star (`GJ 887` is `sys-lacaille9352` there).
// Adding a second copy of a star the GM already has is the fault worth
// preventing; refusing to import a star merely because some OTHER map curates
// it is not, and shipped as a bug — the Local Neighbourhood preset produced an
// empty map, because every host in it is curated somewhere the GM was not
// looking. Callers pass `existingSystemIds`; a new map passes none.

// briefly a hand-kept mirror, which is this codebase's most recurring fault:
// one question answered in two places, waiting to drift.

//     it worked while quietly overwriting curated systems.
// Generated source has neither problem, and follows the existing precedent of
// `src/lib/generated/exampleSystems.ts`.
//
// Staleness is caught, not trusted: `convert.spec.js` walks the roster and
// fails naming the host if the generated file disagrees with it. Add a planet
// host to a bundled system and the suite goes red until the kit is re-run.

// entry point below selects from the EXOPLANET ARCHIVE, so a star with no confirmed planet is not
// in the result set: no Sol, no Alpha Centauri A or B, while Proxima arrives because it happens to
// have planets. Same census, three absences, one category error.
//
// Here the STAR CATALOGUE is the source and the archive is joined onto it.
// ============================================================================

// Match a planet host to a star by POSITION AND DISTANCE, never by name. The archive calls Alpha
// Centauri's faint companion "Proxima Cen" where SIMBAD says "NAME Proxima Centauri"; GJ 876 is
// "BD-15 6290". A name table needs maintaining and fails silently when it drifts.
//
// THE ANGULAR TOLERANCE IS LARGE ON PURPOSE, AND MEASURING IT WAS THE POINT (DATA-R9). The two
// catalogues quote positions at different EPOCHS, and the stars a local map is made of are exactly
// the ones with the largest PROPER MOTION — so the nearest stars are the worst offenders, not the
// best. Measured across every matched host: Barnard's star is out by 161 arcsec, Kapteyn's by 134,
// Proxima by 60. An arcsecond-scale tolerance silently drops precisely the famous stars, which is
// how Alpha Centauri came back with none of Proxima's three planets on the first run.
//
// DISTANCE does the discriminating instead: every true match agreed to better than 1.5%, so 10% is
// a wide margin, and two unrelated stars agreeing on distance to 10% AND lying within five arcmin
// of one another does not happen in a volume this sparse. Closest match wins.
