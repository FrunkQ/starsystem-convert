// Real-sky import — turning a raw stellar cone into SYSTEMS (D18).
//
// "This is a STARMAP importer — clue is in the name. The planets are just a nice add-on." (owner,
// 2026-08-07.) The importer used to select from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, so a star with no
// confirmed planet was never in the result set: no Sol, no Alpha Centauri A or B. Stars are the
// primary object now, and this module is the step between "rows from a star catalogue" and "systems
// on a map".
//
// A raw cone is NOT a census, and the two things wrong with it are both measured, not assumed
// (SIMBAD, everything within 16.5 ly, 2026-08-13):
//
//  1. IT CONTAINS CONTAINERS AS WELL AS STARS. SIMBAD returns a multiple-star SYSTEM entry and its
//     COMPONENTS, inconsistently: Alpha Centauri comes back as three rows ("* alf Cen", "* alf Cen A",
//     "* alf Cen B") where only two are stars, and Kruger 60 and G 272-61 do the same — while Luhman
//     16 and Ross 614 come back as a container only, with no component rows at all. Keeping every row
//     invents phantom stars; dropping every container loses the ones that are the only record of
//     their system. Rule: drop a container ONLY when its components are present.
//
//  2. ITS 3D POSITIONS CANNOT BE SUBTRACTED. Two stars in one system have independently measured
//     parallaxes, and differencing them turns a small measurement error into a huge fake separation.
//     Sirius A and B differ by 1.2% in parallax, which at 8.6 ly fabricates 6,856 AU of separation
//     for a pair genuinely about 20 AU apart; eps Ind and its brown-dwarf pair read 11,698 AU against
//     a true ~1,460. PROJECTED separation — angular separation times the mean distance — cancels the
//     parallax error and recovers both (16 AU and 1,475 AU). Never difference two parallax positions
//     to decide whether stars are companions.
//
// WHAT DECIDES A SYSTEM: the rule the engine ALREADY has, not a new one. `clusterGate.mjs` defines
// the period tiers, and the owner's instruction was to use them and keep them parametrised: bodies
// whose MUTUAL ORBITAL PERIOD is short enough to matter gravitationally share a system;
// longer-period pairs are separate map nodes. `ORBIT_AUTHOR_MAX_PERIOD_YR` (1 Myr) is that line —
// the same constant that makes Sgr A*'s S-stars a single system rather than a starmap.
//
// THE CALIBRATION IS NOT ASSERTED, IT IS CHECKED: with projected separation and the 1 Myr tier, the
// 16.5 ly cone reproduces the hand-curated bundled map's groupings — Alpha Cen A+B (84 yr), Sirius
// A+B, 61 Cygni, Struve 2398, Groombridge 34, Kruger 60, 40 Eridani — and **Proxima joins Alpha
// Centauri at 0.977 Myr**, just inside the tier, exactly as a human placed it. Nothing was tuned to
// make that happen.

// IS THIS ROW A MULTIPLE-STAR CONTAINER, OR A STAR? (D29 - the fault the owner reported as
// "sirius (only adds b)".)
//
// NEITHER THE OTYPE NOR THE SPECTRAL TYPE DECIDES IT ALONE, and assuming the otype did is what lost
// Sirius A. SIMBAD sends, in the same 16.5 ly census:
//   '* alf CMa'   SB*  'A0mA1Va'      Sirius A - A REAL STAR whose companion is unresolved
//   '* alf Cen'   SB*  'G2V+K1V'      a TRUE container - same otype, COMPOSITE type
//   'HD 239960'   **   'M3'           Kruger 60 - a true container with a SINGLE type
//
// `SB*` means "this star IS a spectroscopic binary", which is a statement about a star, not a
// container record - so Sirius A was classified as a container, found its component B present, and
// was dropped. B then inherited the primary slot and the system called Sirius held one white dwarf.
//
// THE RULE: '**' is SIMBAD's multiple-star SYSTEM entry and is always a container. 'SB*' is a
// container only when its spectral type names a SECOND OBJECT - and `companionSpectralType` is what
// answers that, because a bare '+V' is a luminosity class rather than a companion.
