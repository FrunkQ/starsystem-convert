// Single source of truth for per-frame world positions. The 2D orrery and the 3D holo view both
// walk the orbital hierarchy the same way — accumulate each node's propagated offset onto its
// parent — differing ONLY in the propagator: propagateState (flat, ω-only, what the orrery draws)
// vs propagateState3D (full i/Ω rotation, what the holo view needs). Keeping one walk here means
// the two views can never drift in how they place bodies. See docs/dev/v2.2-3d-design.md.
//
// C9: the 3D walk also puts every satellite in the frame its elements are actually quoted in — see
// `../system/satelliteFrame.ts`. That correction used to live in the RENDERER alone, so the
// propagator and the holo view answered "where is this moon" differently, by the parent's axial
// tilt (25.19 deg for Mars, 97.77 for Uranus), and anything else reading positions — the eclipse
// search first — got the wrong plane. It belongs here, once, at the source.
